# C-Exercises
As I am using Mac, I write and test all of the code with VS Code. So, if you are using Windows and Visual Studio, please delete the hidden folders "vscode". 
The are three sub-folders under the project folder "C++": exercise1, exercise2 and exercise3, each contains source codes of questions in each exercises. 
Even seperate the class definition into sh file is the best practice of C++ programming, but for exercising purpose, I put all of the codes of one question into a single .cpp file unless the question requires me to seperate some code into other files.
